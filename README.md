Activiti Cloud Gateway

This project is using the Spring Cloud Gateway project along the Spring Cloud Kubernetes project to create dynamic routes
to the services registered inside a Kubernetes namespace. 

The main goal of this project is to provide a single entrypoint for your client applications to interact with a set of backend services.

Currently a spring.cloud.gateway class is overridden in the project due to these issues:

https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-gateway/issues/229
and
https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-gateway/issues/314

Currently discovery of routes only works on startup and if a new app is added then a POST to /actuator/gateway/refresh is necessary. It's not clear how to resolve this.

Discovery is also limited to the current namespace.
